| `Demand_Variability` | float64 | Variability in product demand (0-1 scale) |

## Machine Learning Models

This analysis implements **four different machine learning algorithms** to predict urgent restocks:

### Models Implemented
1. **XGBoost** - Gradient boosting ensemble method for high-performance predictions
2. **Elastic Net** - Regularized linear regression combining L1 and L2 penalties
3. **Naive Bayes** - Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem
4. **Linear Regression** - Traditional statistical approach for baseline comparison

### Prediction Objective
The models use the **inventory_management_dataset(in).csv** data to predict the `Urgent_Restock` variable, enabling proactive inventory management by identifying products that will require urgent restocking before stockouts occur.

## Analysis Methodology

### 1. Data Exploration & Understanding
- **Dataset Overview**: Comprehensive examination of data structure, types, and basic statistics
